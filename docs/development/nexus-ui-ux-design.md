## Design Philosophy

The Platform Intelligence Agent UI/UX should embody these core principles:

1. **Data-Driven Clarity** - Complex information presented with visual clarity
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Information revealed in layers of increasing detail
3. **Contextual Awareness** - UI adapts to user role and current task
4. **Actionable Insights** - Data visualizations lead directly to actionable steps
5. **Developer-Centric** - Design for technical users without unnecessary simplification

## Color Palette & Typography

### Color System

- **Primary**: Deep blue (#1A365D) - Represents stability and intelligence
- **Secondary**: Teal (#2C7A7B) - For active elements and highlights
- **Accent**: Amber (#D69E2E) - For warnings and attention areas
- **Success**: Green (#38A169) - For positive metrics and success states
- **Error**: Red (#E53E3E) - For critical issues and errors
- **Neutral**: Gray scale (#F7FAFC to #1A202C) - For UI scaffolding

### Typography

- **Headings**: Inter (sans-serif), semi-bold
- **Body**: Inter (sans-serif), regular
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono (monospace) - For code snippets and technical data
- **Data Visualization**: Inter (sans-serif), medium - For labels and legends

## Key UI Components

### 1. Global Navigation

- **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible, with icons and labels
- **Quick Access Bar**: Pinned repositories, recent alerts, and saved queries
- **Context Switcher**: Switch between organizations, projects, and views
- **Search**: Global search with context-aware filtering

### 2. Dashboard Components

- **Metric Cards**: Key performance indicators with trend indicators
- **Alert Panels**: Prioritized issues requiring attention
- **Timeline Views**: Activity and change history visualization
- **Status Indicators**: Health metrics with visual encoding (color, shape)

### 3. Knowledge Graph Visualization

- **Interactive Graph View**: Force-directed layout with zoom/pan controls
- **Entity Cards**: Detailed information on hover/selection
- **Relationship Lines**: Styled according to relationship type
- **Filtering Controls**: Dynamic filtering by entity type, relationship, and metadata

### 4. Code Intelligence Views

- **Dependency Maps**: Visual representation of code dependencies
- **Impact Analysis**: Heat maps showing change impact
- **Code Health**: Visual representation of code quality metrics
- **Trend Charts**: Historical data visualized as sparklines or area charts

### 5. Notification System

- **Priority-Based Styling**: Visual distinction between severity levels
- **Actionable Notifications**: Direct links to relevant views or actions
- **Grouping Mechanism**: Similar notifications grouped for reduced noise
- **Persistent History**: Accessible log of past notifications

## Screen Designs

### 1. Main Dashboard

- Top section: Organization-wide metrics and alerts
- Middle section: Repository health overview with filtering
- Bottom section: Recent activity and upcoming risks

### 2. Repository Detail View

- Header: Repository metadata and key metrics
- Tabs:
  - Overview: Health score, activity level, contributor stats
  - Structure: Code organization and architecture visualization
  - Dependencies: Internal and external dependency mapping
  - Changes: Recent commits, PRs, and their impact
  - Issues: Quality concerns and technical debt items

### 3. Impact Analysis Screen

- Change selection panel: Choose commits or branches to analyze
- Central visualization: Component map with impact highlighting
- Detail panel: Affected components and risk assessment
- Action panel: Suggested testing strategies and review points

### 4. Developer Insights View

- Activity metrics: Contribution patterns and focus areas
- Quality indicators: Code health trends for owned components
- Collaboration network: Team interaction visualization
- Knowledge distribution: Expertise mapping across codebase

### 5. Administration & Settings

- Clean, form-based interfaces with logical grouping
- Visual feedback for system status and integration health
- Clear separation between organization, project, and user settings

## Interaction Patterns

### 1. Information Discovery

- **Progressive Drill-Down**: Start with high-level overview, click for details
- **Contextual Side Panels**: Show related information without losing context
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clear path showing current location in information hierarchy

### 2. Data Visualization Interactions

- **Hover States**: Rich tooltips with key metrics and explanations
- **Selection Behavior**: Click to focus, double-click to drill down
- **Cross-Filtering**: Selections in one view filter content in others
- **Time Range Selection**: Adjustable time windows for all temporal data

### 3. Task Completion Flows

- **Guided Analysis**: Step-by-step flows for complex analysis tasks
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain state when switching between related views
- **Quick Actions**: Common tasks accessible via keyboard shortcuts and context menus

## Responsive Design Considerations

- **Desktop Focus**: Optimize for large screens with dense information displays
- **Tablet Adaptation**: Reorganize panels for medium screens, maintain core functionality
- **Mobile View**: Focused views showing critical alerts and simplified metrics
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features available on all devices, advanced features on larger screens

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements
- Provide alternative text for all data visualizations
- Design with color blindness considerations (avoid red/green distinctions)
- Support screen readers with proper ARIA attributes

## Implementation Recommendations

- Implement using React with styled-components or Chakra UI
- Use D3.js for custom visualizations
- Implement responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Create a component library for consistency
- Use React Context for theming support (dark/light modes)
