# Nexus Platform AI

## Overview

Nexus Platform AI is a Platform Intelligence Agent (PIA) designed to provide predictive change risk analysis for modern software systems. It connects previously siloed data sources and applies machine learning to predict the potential impact of changes before deployment, transforming reactive incident management into proactive risk mitigation.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Change Intelligence**
   - Analyzes code diffs, infrastructure changes, config updates
   - Identifies affected components and potential side effects

2. **Historical Pattern Recognition**
   - Correlates past incidents with code/infrastructure changes
   - Maps service dependencies and failure modes

3. **Risk Forecasting**
   - Assigns risk scores to proposed changes
   - Predicts likelihood of outages for specific services

4. **Proactive Mitigation**
   - Suggests targeted testing strategies
   - Recommends deployment approaches and safeguards

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 months)**
   - Basic integrations and data collection
   - Initial knowledge graph structure
   - Simple rule-based analysis

2. **Phase 2: Basic Intelligence (2-3 months)**
   - Preliminary risk classification models
   - Correlation between changes and incidents
   - Developer feedback mechanisms

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (3-4 months)**
   - Enhanced ML techniques
   - Detailed blast radius analysis
   - Mitigation recommendation system

4. **Phase 4: Proactive Operations (4-6 months)**
   - Predictive SLO/SLA violation detection
   - Automated mitigation execution options
   - Scenario analysis capabilities
